Document::ISO8859_1_Map

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package defines a hash to map Latin1 ligatures and characters
like LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S (ß) to two characters on input of OCR
for XPAT indexing and of the users qusry string.  Solr/Lucene performs
this mapping using the ISOLatin1AccentFilter.  XPAT cannot map a
single character to to characters.

The map is taken from ISOLatin1AccentFilter.java.
