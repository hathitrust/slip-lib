Document::Doc::Data::File

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class encapsulates the retrieval of text to build a Solr document
that contains the text of one or all "pages" of an item.

A "page" consists of the contents of one or all OCR .txt files or
of the entire textual content of an XML structured document.

This subclass builds auxillary fields for the seq and pgnum Solr
document fields.
