package Document::Wrapper;

=head1 NAME

Document::Wrapper

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class defines a sub to wrap multiple instances of Lucene document
content produced by a Document subclass.  

The Document::Generator generate_next() method is typically called in
a loop for a given document_id.  The loop result can be many Solr
documents (D=<doc>...</doc>). It is more efficient to package up
several document and wrap them with a single <add>D D D D D...</add>
element.

The caller of Document::Generator and Document::Wrapper can control
the size of the <add>.
