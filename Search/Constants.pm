=head1 NAME

Search::Constants

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package defines values retruned by the indexing code and checked
by application code and stored in slip_errors table in the ht database.

It also includes a map of class B IP addresses and corresponding site
names that key item_ids in index queues for multisite application
indexing support.

=item indexing_failed

Indexing is OK if good HTTP status (200). The HTTP timeout=30. We are
going to assume an IX_INDEX_TIMEOUT succeeded at the server and so, is
not an error. True errors are, document construction failed due to
metadata failure or ocr failure, or Solr parse error or server gone.
